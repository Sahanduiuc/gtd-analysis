#### Social data analysis and visualization of the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)
The database comprises of 150k incidents of terrorism around the globe.

The focus was on creating beautiful visualizations. Instead of producing static, boring charts, we managed to develop an interactive dashboard which enables every visitor of my website to explore the terrorism in the area of their interest. For this, we used d3.js, the state-of-the-art JavaScript library for building interactive charts. 

Highly encourage you to visit the [interactive website](https://polakowo.io/gtd-analysis/project/) and [explainer notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/polakowo/socialdata2017/blob/master/project/jupyter/AssignmentProject-ExplainerNotebook.ipynb).
